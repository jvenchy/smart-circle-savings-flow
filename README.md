## 🏆 Hackathon Challenge

**Built for Loblaw's Corporate Hackathon 2025**

> *"How can AI transform individual shopping into social experiences that combine loyalty and reward systems that encourage healthy spending habits and collective rewards?"*

Our solution: **SmartCircles** - An AI-driven platform that automatically groups neighbors into shopping communities, enabling collective savings and healthier spending through gamified challenges.

## 🚀 Key Innovation

### The Problem
- Traditional loyalty programs suffer from **53% customer fatigue** (rewards take too long)
- **54% of users** can't easily access rewards on mobile
- Individual shopping lacks community benefits and accountability
- No solution exists for **neighborhood-based collective buying power**

### Our Solution
SmartCircles uses **life-stage AI classification** and **geospatial algorithms** to automatically form neighborhood shopping groups that:
- ✅ Earn **real cash rewards** through weekend challenges
- ✅ Unlock **group discounts** impossible for individual shoppers  
- ✅ Adapt dynamically as users' **life stages evolve**
- ✅ Require **zero social pressure** - all coordination handled by AI

---

## 🎯 Core Features

### 🤖 AI Circle Formation Engine
```typescript
// Life-stage classification using OpenAI API
const classification = await classifyUserProfile(transactionSummary);
// Geographic clustering with Haversine distance
const distance = calculateHaversineDistance(coords1, coords2);
// Dynamic matching: location + life stage + spending patterns
const compatibilityScore = calculateMatchScore(user, circle);
```

**Smart Neighbor Matching:**
- Analyzes transaction patterns to determine life stage (new parent, young professional, etc.)
- Uses geocoding to find users within 3-5km community radius
- Matches compatible spending habits (budget-conscious, organic-focused, bulk buyers)
- **Automatically rebalances** circles as life circumstances change

### 💰 Weekend Cash Challenge System
```typescript
interface WeekendChallenge {
  title: "Spend $200+ on fresh produce as a group"
  reward: "$60 cash split evenly"
  participants: "opt-in only"
  timeframe: "Friday-Sunday"
}
```

**Real Money Rewards:**
- **Opt-in participation** - no pressure, no judgment
- **Equal distribution** - every participant gets same reward regardless of individual spending
- **Instant gratification** - cash credited within 24 hours
- **Community goals** - nutrition, sustainability, local support challenges

### 🛍️ Collective Savings Engine
```typescript
// Dynamic group pricing triggers
if (circleInterest >= 3 && timeWindow <= 24) {
  const groupDiscount = negotiateVolumePricing(supplier, quantity);
  notifyCircleMembers(groupDiscount);
}
```

**Automated Group Deals:**
- **Volume discounts** when 3+ circle members want same products
- **24-hour deal windows** for time-sensitive coordination  
- **Transparent pricing** - see exactly how much you save
- **Smart notifications** - only relevant deals for your preferences

### 🗣️ AI Communication Manager
```typescript
// Zero social pressure - AI handles all coordination
const aiMessage = generateCommunication({
  type: "challenge_progress",
  data: { progress: 60, goalAmount: 200 },
  tone: "encouraging_professional"
});
```

**Frictionless Coordination:**
- **No group chats** - eliminates social anxiety and time burden
- **Predetermined responses** - simple tap interactions only
- **Professional tone** - banking app-level polish, not social media chaos
- **Privacy-first** - minimal personal information sharing
